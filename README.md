# School-Management-System-in-C-
School Management System in C++: A program to manage school data with students and courses. Implements a UML class diagram, separates control, view, entity, and collection objects, and works with static and dynamic arrays. Created by Mehreen J, Flowra A., Haifa A, Mageda A.

# Goal and Learning outcomes
The goal of this project is to develop a C++ program for managing student and course data in a school. The project uses UML class diagrams to implement different classes and objects for controlling, viewing, and managing the school system data. The learning outcomes of this project include:

<br>- Practice implementing a design given in a UML class diagram
<br>- Implement a program that is separated into control, view, entity, and collection objects
<br>- Work with statically allocated and dynamically allocated arrays


# Purpose
This program's purpose is to manage a school system that displays a list of courses and students, manages the students' courses and their details such as student ID and name. The program also manages the list of courses and students according to their details and information.

# Functionality
The program is executed through the main file, which starts up the school class. The user can select a function from the list and complete the desired process according to their needs.
